# DEMs

> Solving for diffusion-induced stresses using the energy method
* We provide a total of two examples, a hollow cylinder `ThickCylinder_Diffusion_DEM.py` and a hollow sphere `Spherical_Diffusion_DEM.py`. 
* We also give the models we have trained, and the related usage and notes are shown in the comments in the code. For example, the neural network structure used in our trained model is `2-32-32-2`, so the neural network structure set in the code should also be this structure
